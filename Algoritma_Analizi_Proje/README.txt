#This is a project of Analysis of Algorithms.
#Coded with C language.

#Includes:
	*5-distance-example: It's an example some given inputs (aktor names)
	*AlgoritmaAnalizi_DonemProjesi: PDF of given homework. It says what must be done.
	*data.txt: Our data which we run BFS algorithm on it.
	*main.c: Source code.
	*main.exe: Executable file of our compiled source code.
	
#The purpose is so similar to "kevin bacon number algorithm". You can also Google it.
#It is a shortest path problem with BFS (breadth first search).
